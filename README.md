## My Quiz

I was able to create an app that meets the criteria for the assignment. Users "Start" quiz and have 75 seconds to answer the 5 questions. Incorrect answers received a penalty of 15 seconds, and once the quiz is over, users could save their scores.

Users can also click a link to the highscore page from the homepage.
